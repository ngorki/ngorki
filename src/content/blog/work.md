I recently saw a video from a creator I appreciate, Mirian, talking about a book covering bullshit jobs. Jobs that seemingly provide no value to anyone, yet continue to exist. About 40% of people working bullshit jobs *know* they're working bullshit jobs, according to her excerpt of the book. If we *know* we're working bullshit jobs, why do we continune to create them in the first place? Surely that's a waste of time and money for everyone involved. The company spends their money hiring, training, and fully employing these people, and the employees simply turn the cogs of their machine. For the employees, it's easy to emphathize. A job is better than no job, and many of these bullshit jobs exist in large corporations where the work is far less taxing physically and emotionally than say service work or manual labor and the pay is often decent enough
